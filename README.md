# Module 0: Welcome to the course!

## Overview
Welcome to INFO-498c, Population Health Metrics. This is a course at the University of Washington's [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/), and these materials were developed by [Michael Freeman](http://mfviz.com/#/). The purpose of this course is to teach students the necessary technical skills asking sophisticated questions of public health data. While these resources are built for students currently enrolled in the course, they have been structured to be an online resource for anyone hoping to learn the software tools necessary for working with public health data.

For more **foundational skills**, please see the learning modules for [INFO-201, Technical Foundations of Informatics](https://github.com/info-201)

## Expectations
Given the ever-changing nature of the coding world, students will be responsible for independent learning, both in terms of managing their own pace, and seeking out new skills. These modules have been designed to provide an introduction to core concepts necessary for success in the course.


## Organization
This organization has a separate repository for each major topic (module). Each module contains (some of) the following:

- A tutorial on the specified skill(s)
- Links to supplementary learning materials
- Exercises for practicing the skills

All exercises provide an instructional template, as well as the completed version of the exercise. More specifically, each learning module with exercises has both `master` and `complete` branches (more on this later). To view the `complete` branch on GitHub, you can easily use the UI to change branches:

![change-branch](imgs/change-branch.png)

You can also access the code on your computer by checking out the branch via your terminal:

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repository
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/m3-git-intro.git

# Checkout the `complete` branch:
git checkout complete
```

The `complete` branch of each repo has the completed exercises.  While these were included for your benefit, I **_strongly suggest_** you complete exercises for topics that you aren't completely comfortable with.  Assignments will presume you have mastered the skills of corresponding modules.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this repository by adding an exercise, making an edit, or suggesting a new module, please [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/), or make the change in a fork of this repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).  I expect these resources to be continually improving.
